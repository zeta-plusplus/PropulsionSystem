      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    OMPython is a Python interface to OpenModelica.\n",
      "    To get started, create an OMCSession/OMCSessionZMQ object:\n",
      "    from OMPython import OMCSession/OMCSessionZMQ\n",
      "    omc = OMCSession()/OMCSessionZMQ()\n",
      "    omc.sendExpression(command)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Note: Conversion from OMPython 1.0 to OMPython 2.0 is very simple\n",
      "    1.0:\n",
      "    import OMPython\n",
      "    OMPython.execute(command)\n",
      "    2.0:\n",
      "    from OMPython import OMCSession\n",
      "    OMPython = OMCSession()\n",
      "    OMPython.execute(command)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    OMPython 3.0 includes a new class OMCSessionZMQ uses PyZMQ to communicate\n",
      "    with OpenModelica. A new argument `useCorba=False` is added to ModelicaSystem\n",
      "    class which means it will use OMCSessionZMQ by default. If you want to use\n",
      "    OMCSession then create ModelicaSystem object like this,\n",
      "    obj = ModelicaSystem(useCorba=True)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The difference between execute and sendExpression is the type of the\n",
      "    returned expression. sendExpression maps Modelica types to Python types,\n",
      "    while execute tries to map also output that is not valid Modelica.\n",
      "    That format is harder to use.\n",
